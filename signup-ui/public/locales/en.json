KHID allows access to services requiring a higher level of security electronic identification/authentication. The list of partners from KHID is available here: URL link or logo of private sectors/public services</p><p>The online service provider you want to connect that defines the level of assurance of identification/authentication required to access its online services(s).</p><p>To use KHID, you must (L2):</p><ul><li>If you are Cambodian, be registered with an Identity card/passport so that your identity data has been verified.</li><li>If you are a foreigner, be registered with a passport so that your identity data has been verified.</li></ul><p>To use KHID, you must (L1):</p><ul><li>registered with a mobile phone number so that your identity data has been verified.</li></ul><p>The KHID is responsible for making the bridge between the Identity Supplier and the Service Provider by generating a unique technical identifier. Thus, following your successful identification/authentication with the Identity card/passport you have chosen, the latter sends your identity data (phone number, full name in Khmer). The KHID then questions the Mobile phone service provider for identification via an OTP code (One-time password) code to check that you exist. If your identification/authentication is validated, the selected identity data may be transmitted from your Service Provider to the Service Provider. You are then connected to the online service of the Service provider.</p><p>Access to KHID is free of charge.</p><h4>Our Responsibilities</h4><p>We may not be held liable for identity theft or any fraudulent use of KHID. We cannot be held liable for any damage caused by any person Unauthorized using your usernames and passwords. You are reminded that anyone who makes a false declaration for itself, or others shall be liable.</p><p>We reserve the right to block your access, without notice or compensation of any kind, in the event of a suspicion of illegal, fraudulent, or contrary to these general conditions of use.</p><h4>Your Responsibilities</h4><p>It is up to you to comply with the conditions of use of the identification service and electronic authentication subscribed to your Identity Provider. It belongs to You in particular, never to disclose your login details and passwords, which must remain confidential.</p><p>It is up to you to comply with the conditions of use of the service as defined by the Supplier of service. In particular, we recommend that you log out at the end of your navigation.</p><h4>Quality Of Services</h4><p>The KHID may be interrupted, without prior notice, in particular for reasons of maintenance, safety, or cases of force majeure. An information message indicating this unavailability may be displayed. The unavailability of the KHID does not entitle you to any compensation.</p><h4>Contact US</h4><p>Under this function a user can contact KHID’s Customer Support Center via the available feedback form, or call-in to our hotline number XX XXX XXX.</p>",
