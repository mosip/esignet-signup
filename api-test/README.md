# ESignet Signup API Test Rig

## Overview

The **ESignet Signup API Test Rig** is designed for the execution of module-wise automation API tests for the esignet signup services. This test rig utilizes **Java REST Assured** and **TestNG** frameworks to automate testing of the esignet signup service API functionalities. The key focus is to validate the Register user, Reset password, Identity verification and related functionalities provided by the esignet signup service module.

---

## Test Categories

- **Smoke**: Contains only positive test scenarios for quick verification.
- **Regression**: Includes all test scenarios, covering both positive and negative cases.

---

## Coverage

This test rig covers only **external API endpoints** exposed by the esignet signup services module.

---

# API Test Rig Signup Configuration

The API Test Rig is configured to work with different core service plugins, such as MOSIP-ID and Mock-Identity-System. It allows for dynamic testing and validation of workflows related to identity management and authentication, specifically for the signup process.

## Integration of eSignet-signup API Test Rig with Core Service Plugins

The Test Rig is dynamically configured based on the core service plugin being tested (either MOSIP-ID or Mock-Identity-System). The configuration is as follows:

### 1. Configuration for MOSIP-ID Plugin:
- **eSignetbaseurl**: The Test Rig will use the live eSignet instance integrated with the MOSIP-ID service.
- **signupBaseUrl**: The Test Rig will use the live Signup instance integrated with the MOSIP-ID service.
- **schemaVersion**: Specifies the schema version in case the environment has multiple schemas (e.g., "v1.0", "v2.0", etc.).
- **mosip_components_base_urls**: A string defining the base URLs for various components.
- **esignetActuatorPropertySection**: To fetch the configuration and properties from the actuator for service interactions.

### 2. Configuration for Mock-Identity-System Plugin:
- **eSignetbaseurl**: The Test Rig will use the live eSignet instance integrated with the Mock-Identity-service.
- **signupBaseUrl**: The Test Rig will use the live Signup instance integrated with the Mock-Identity-service.
- **usePreConfiguredOtp**: A flag to use pre-configured OTPs. Set to "true" for OTP-based workflows.
- **esignetActuatorPropertySection**: To fetch the configuration and properties from the actuator for service interactions.


### Deployment Configuration (Required for API Test Rig):
These configurations need to be added as part of the eSignet service deployment to support the API Test Rig:

- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_AUTHENTICATE_ATTEMPTS**: 300
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_SEND_OTP_ATTEMPTS**: 300
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_AUTH_CHALLENGE_BIO_MAX_LENGTH**: 200000
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_PREAUTHENTICATION_EXPIRE_IN_SECS**: 600
- **MOSIP_ESIGNET_CAPTCHA_REQUIRED**: (empty)

These configurations need to be added as part of the Signup service deployment to support the API Test Rig:

- **MOSIP_SIGNUP_SEND_CHALLENGE_CAPTCHA_REQUIRED**: false


These parameters must be included in the eSignet and signup deployment YAML for the API Test Rig to function correctly, independent of which plugin is being used.
